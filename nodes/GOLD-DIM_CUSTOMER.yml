          This column is a system-generated timestamp indicating when a record became the current version.
          - It is populated with the current timestamp when a new record is inserted or an existing record is updated.
          - It does not have a source column; its value is derived using the SQL transformation 'CAST(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AS TIMESTAMP)'.
          - This timestamp supports temporal data analysis, allowing users to track when customer data became valid.
          - It is crucial for audit trails and historical reporting.
